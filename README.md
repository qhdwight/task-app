# Task App

An application that keeps tracks of tasks for your current project.
There are three categories for a task, new (to be done later), in progress, and done.
Tasks can be created, moved, an destroyed, the last two being done by dragging the task around.
Tasks are saved in the cloud so you can log in elsewhere and see them.

This app uses electron, react, firebase, and uses node and npm for package management.
Electron renders the html/css into a native window, react provides a templating system, and firebase is used to store tasks for each user.
